Programs trying to complete a Knights Tour 

As a messing with python and getting my brain in gear, i have created a couple of different wasy to complete a Knight's Tour. 
see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour

At the moment there are 4 programs here:
* 01 - purely random
* 02 - check which moves are actually valid before (so essentially the same as 01, with checking)
* 03 - check which moves after this move have the most options
* 04 - the opposite of 03, which move has the least options after this move (where i inadvertently independently discovered Warnsdorf's rule, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour#Warnsdorf's_rule)


# Todo
* add check to see whether tour is open or closed
* create a test to chekc if solution is actually valid (hopefully they all are)
* dump completed tours into "something" and keep a record of solved tours
